# ME.TASK1
Robotic Arm 3D Model
This project is a 3D model of a robotic arm with a claw gripper, designed using Tinkercad or a similar 3D design tool. The robotic arm consists of multiple segments connected via joints, mimicking the structure and motion of a real robotic manipulator.

🧩 Components
Base Platform: A stable square base that supports the entire arm.

Arm Segments (Red): Four articulated segments represent the arm's upper and lower parts.

Joints (Blue): Spherical connectors that simulate rotation or bending movement at each point of articulation.

Gripper (Grey): A two-finger claw mechanism at the end of the arm, intended to grab or manipulate objects.

🛠️ Purpose
The model is designed to:

Demonstrate the structure of a robotic arm.

Visualize mechanical movement in robotic joints.

Be used for 3D printing (if scaled correctly).

Serve as an educational project for beginners learning about robotics and mechanical design.

📐 Software Used
Tinkercad (recommended)

STL export supported for 3D printing.

🔄 Possible Improvements
Add motors or servos for motion simulation.

Design internal holes for wiring (if planning physical build).

Animate or simulate movement in Unity or Blender.
